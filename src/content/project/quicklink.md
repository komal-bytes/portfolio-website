**QuickLink** is a serverless URL shortener app that simplifies sharing long links while providing real-time analytics. Developed using **React** and **Next UI** for the frontend, **SST** (Serverless Stack) for infrastructure, and **Hono** as the API framework, the app leverages **DynamoDB** for efficient data management and **Supabase** for secure authentication. QuickLink offers features like customizable short links, QR code generation, and sharing options for popular platforms like WhatsApp,  Telegram, LinkedIn or share it via mail. With an emphasis on scalability and performance, QuickLink is ideal for individuals and businesses looking for a modern, serverless URL management solution.
