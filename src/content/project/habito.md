**Habito** is a fully offline habit tracker app designed to help users build and maintain positive routines effortlessly. Built with **React**, **Vite**, **Typescript** and **Tailwind CSS**, the app integrates **Dexie** for local data storage, ensuring user information remains completely private without reliance on external servers. Habito offers features like creating and managing habits, installing the app to run it offline, pause/resume the habits and tracking progress through visually appealing charts using **react-chartjs-2**. The app provides a smooth, interactive experience. Itâ€™s perfect for users seeking a lightweight, privacy-focused self help tool.
